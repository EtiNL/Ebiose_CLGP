To implement graph encoders for producing embeddings, we can explore several architectures that have been developed and refined over recent years. Here are some notable papers and their contributions to this field:

1. **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)**:
   - **Paper**: "Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks" by Thomas Kipf and Max Welling (2017)
   - **Summary**: This foundational paper introduces GCNs, which apply convolution operations to graph-structured data. The approach leverages spectral graph theory to perform convolutions directly on graphs, making it effective for semi-supervised learning tasks.
